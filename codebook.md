#####
subjectID - a numerical ID unique to each subject under study; 30 subjects total
activity - a text description of the activity undertaken during data collection

The following are measurements averaged to the subject-activity level.  Each of these
measurements has an X, Y, and Z component to correspond to the radial direction of the
measurment.
